Hola and Welcome viewers !!..

This repository is basically for the project I along with my team created in our very first Hackathon , i.e. , "HackBMU 4.0"..

Our Team was ranked in top 20 among the participating teams !!..
We Created An App and A website to promote awareness about LGBTQ community ..
The people who joined the community were to be called "Gliders"..
And We named the initiative "Let'em Glide"..

The App contained a menu list activity and was creaed using JAVA In Android Studio.
The Website was created in Wordpress (As the decision to create it was spontaneous).

Thanks To ,
